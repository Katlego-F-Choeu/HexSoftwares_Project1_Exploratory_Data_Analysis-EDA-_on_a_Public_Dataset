Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health Dataset

Choose a simple, publicly available dataset (e.g., Iris, Titanic, or a dataset
from Kaggle).
** Chose a dataset that focuses on Remote work and mental health, and the data I focused on mainly was the age, hours worked per week, work life balance rating, and social isolation rating

Clean the data, handle missing values, and perform basic statistical analysis.
** When I cleaned the data I found that the Mental Health Condition is having 1196 missing entries, as well as Physical Activities having 1629 missing entries
** Then I had to removed columns with text, because it would give a data type conversion error(casting string to float)
** 

Visualize data distributions, correlations, and key patterns using charts and graphs.
Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Jupyter Notebook.
